A plugin that adds simple features to help make your WordPress site
multilingual.

== Description ==

JDesrosiers Multilingual is a Plugin that adds simple features, such as a
language taxonomy, to help you make Multilingual WordPress sites without
creating extra tables in your database or polluting your post entries with
shortcodes.

It needs a bit more work (not that much) from you. But it works great if
you create your own theme from scratch.

For now, it only supports two languages. 

This project is hosted on https://github.com/juliend2/jdesrosiers-multilingual

== Installation ==

1. Upload `jdesrosiers-multilingual` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go in Pages -> Language, and add your two languages from there. Name should
be something like "English", and Slug should be something like "en" (two
lowercase letters).
1. In Settings -> Permalinks, put the following in the "Custom Structure"
field: `/%language%/%postname%/` . This will prepend the language slug to your
post permalinks.
1. In your template, add this tag where you want the language switcher
to appear: `<?php the_language_switcher(); ?>`
1. Add a file named `taxonomy-language.php` in your theme, with the following
content:
	<?php
	/*
	Modify the current query to only get the page, and not the list of all the 
	pages in this language.
	*/
	$lang_slug = get_query_var('language');
	query_posts(array(
	  'pagename' => $lang_slug
	));

	get_template_part('content', 'home');
1. Create a file named `content-home.php` in your theme, with whatever you
want as a home page.
1. Make sure you set "Your latest post" in Settings > Reading > Front page
displays.
1. You now have to create a "Page" entry for the home page of every language
you want to support. And for its slug, give it the locale name (like 'en' or
'fr').
1. Every page that you want to appear under `/fr/` (in the URL) must be a child
page of its corresponding home page. For example, the About page must be a
child page of the Home page to appear under the `/en/about/` URL.
1. For each page, you must also choose a "Language" in the Language taxonomy
box at the right. And you must set a corresponding page in the other language
as well in the "Corresponding Object" box.
1. Add the following at the very top of your index.php file:
	if (JDML::get_current_language_slug() === '') {
	  wp_redirect(site_url().'/en', 301);
	}

Right now, it only supports two languages. It is not my priority to support
